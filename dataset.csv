2.2 
BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING / MANAGEMENT – GENERAL REQUIREMENTS 
A. 
A Coordination model produced using Building Information Modeling software is to be 
developed by all BIM participants.  This model will be utilized to establish field installation 
sequence, resolve trade coordination issues prior to installation, and to make the most efficient 
use of installation space without sacrifice to system performance for mechanical, electrical, 
structural and assigned architectural systems.  This method will use multiple BIM design review 
software platforms as a means of documenting, identifying and resolving inter-relationships and 
possible interferences between all trades' Work and the architectural features as using the 
model to schedule, provide quantity takeoffs and serve as the as-built of the facility. 
B. 
Communication is a critical element to the success of this coordination process.  Each 
Subcontractor, the Design Team Members, the Owner, and General Contractor/CM must be in 
constant communication to keep the process moving forward in a timely manner and per the 
sign-off schedule.  Constant collaboration is expected of all team participants and each 
participant should be proactive in identification and resolution of the design engineering and 
model interferences.   
C. 
General Contractor/CM will facilitate and lead the BIM Process.  General Contractor/CM will be 
the final authority on model issues.  It is the responsibility of all BIM participants to resolve 
discrepancies pertaining to their own model.  Each Subcontractor shall purchase at its own 
cost licenses of Navisworks 2014 including any maintenance and software updates during the 
course of the Project. 
D. 
All BIM participants are required to attend all model review meetings, are expected to",30,Navisworks 2014,"[36, 31, 37]","[35, 35, 32]","[29, 119, 34]"
What is the purpose of the weekly BIM Development Meetings?,"H. Typical utility corridors and above ceiling space zones for each trade will be established by the 
group at the beginning of the process.  These zones will be adjusted through the coordination 
process to meet actual installation req uirements during system development.   
I. All participants are required to identify those submittals required for accurate detailing of the 
coordination model (such as equipment, light fixtures, etc.) and are to make those submittals a 
priority in obtaining f inal approval so the specific information can be incorporated into the 
modeling process.   
J. All BIM participants are required to produce a BIM with all information typically included on their 
shop drawings. BIM may not replace the standard submittal process  and all contractors will be 
required to produce 2D shop drawings from their BIM as requested.   
K. At the Weekly BIM Development  Meeting:  
1. The purpose of the Weekly BIM Development Meeting is the review and resolution of 
items that are found as models are de veloped in conjunction with the project schedule.  
The meetings will focus on clashes that cannot be resolved by internal collaboration, 
additional information that needs to be placed with model objects to support scheduling 
and estimating goals, and / or review of design changes to be incorporated. General
